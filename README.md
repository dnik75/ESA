# ESA
On Tuesday, October 20th, 2020 I've presented my Master thesis "Applied machine learning on ESA therapy application for kidney patients" at Singidunum University, (Belgrade, Serbia), and have obtained a degree of Master engineer in Data Science. My mentor was professor Milan Milosavljevic.

The goal of the thesis was to try to use machine learning to determine if the application of ESA therapy on kidney patients can cause thrombosis, brain stroke, or cardiac arrest. All patients in the database have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and multiple comorbidities.
ESA - Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are medications that stimulate the bone marrow to make red blood cells. ESAs are used to maintain hemoglobin at the lowest level that both minimizes transfusions and best meets a person's needs. Medical specialty professional organizations do not recommend the use of ESAs in people with CKD.

After data cleaning, I've applied the Random forest classifier, Gradient boosting classifier, Randomized search CV, and Lebel encoder. I've used two versions of the dataset with different columns data organization to try to find best results. 

Unfortunately, there was an insufficient number of patients with thrombosis, brain stroke, or cardiac arrest in the database, so our model, in some cases got overtrained and with high variance and low bias.Â
